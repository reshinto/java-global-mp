## Implementation effectiveness

### Iterative vs Recursive binary search

- time complexity for both iterative and recursive solutions are `O log(N)`
- space complexity for iterative is `O (1)` and recursive is `O log(N)`

```
Total time for iterative binary search: 2144 ns
Total time for recursive binary search: 1637 ns
```

### Design pattern used is Strategy
